//! Utilities to integrate Rust services with Datadog using [`opentelemetry`],
//! [`tracing`], and other open source libraries.
//!
//! This is an opinionated crate providing the building blocks for a setup that
//! works with Datadog. It has been tested with services using [`axum`] hosted
//! on AWS ECS, with propagation working when requests are made to other services
//! using [`reqwest`].
